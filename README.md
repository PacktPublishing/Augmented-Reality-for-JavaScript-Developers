# Augmented Reality for JavaScript Developers [Video]
This is the code repository for [Augmented Reality for JavaScript Developers [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/augmented-reality-javascript-developers-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788471640), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Augmented reality is the idea of mixing computer-generated media with someone’s view of the real world. AR.js provides a framework and set of utilities to develop augmented reality applications efficiently just using web technologies.

This course will show the learning ropes on how to produce interactive augmented reality experiences with nothing but a set of web technologies such as JavaScript and HTML. We'll start off with a basic introduction to Augmented reality experiences and an introduction to all the libraries and development tools that we are going to utilize in this video course. We'll begin by setting up our basic structure for our very first AR web application using the AR.js framework. We then move on to setting up our camera feed to localize our AR markers. After that, we'll deep dive into learning to overlay 3D content on top of our markers with three.js where we'll learn to apply realistic lighting and shadows to the 3D objects that we create using the different camera controls provided by Three.js to effortlessly navigate around your 3D scenes. After getting our 3D right we'll learn how to integrate both the 3D and our camera feed onto the screen. Towards the end of the video, we'll create a couple of real-world AR web application to better apply our gained knowledge.Finally, we get started into building Projects such as a 3D business card and AR data histogram.

By the time we are done with the course we would be able to create AR applications with A-Frame along with AR.js and with awe.js and also create Business cards and Data histograms.
